# Project-5

## Project description

In this project I work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert ratings, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. I need to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow me to identify potential successes and plan advertising campaigns.

The data available goes back to 2016. Let's imagine that it is December 2016 and you are planning a campaign for 2017.

(The important thing is to have experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether I'm forecasting 2017 sales based on 2016 data or 2027 sales based on 2026 data.)

The dataset contains a "rating" column that stores the ESRB rating for each game. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating, such as Teen or Mature.

Note: This project was developed based on the guidance I received to improve my logical reasoning as a student. As a result, I kept all requested orders related to guidance on carrying out the necessary calculations.
